"""Apply the FORBIDDEN_NAMES policy to the ISSUES and PULL REQUESTS (#428).

`ci-check-citability.py` scans the tracked tree, which is the right surface
while the tree is the only public thing. Making the working repository public
changes that: 248 issues and 179 pull requests — titles, bodies, every comment,
every review comment — change state at the same time, and none of them has ever
been read by the policy that decides what may be named.

Not a gate, and deliberately not one:

  * it needs the network and a token with issue read scope, so it cannot be a
    step that fails a build offline;
  * it is a ONE-OFF, run before a visibility change. A gate implies something
    to keep green afterwards; what keeps this green afterwards is not writing
    the name in the first place.

It prints WHERE, never WHAT. The founder runs it with the secret in his own
environment, and the output can be pasted anywhere — a hit reads
`issue #212 · body · 1 match [9 chars]`. `--show` exists for reading it alone
on his own screen, and says so.

    FORBIDDEN_NAMES_FILE=~/.config/serverstartup/forbidden-names \\
        python3 scripts/audit-citability-issues.py

Exit codes follow the house convention: 0 clean, 1 hits found, 3 the scan
could not prove it can match anything — which is not the same as clean.
