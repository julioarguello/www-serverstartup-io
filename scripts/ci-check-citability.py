"""ci-check-citability.py — nobody non-citable gets named, and the guard proves it can tell (#347).

The previous version was six lines of shell with three holes, all of the same
family: from outside, a guard that finds nothing looks exactly like a guard
that cannot find anything.

  1. It exited 0 when FORBIDDEN_NAMES was absent, calling it "public mirror".
     Delete the secret, rotate it badly, rename it — and the guard passes
     forever, silently. The mirror is identified by its REPOSITORY, not by a
     missing secret, so that is what decides now: on the private repo an
     absent secret is a failure.

  2. Nothing proved the pattern could match. A broken regex, a name that
     changed shape ("Toys \"R\" Us" vs "ToysRUs"), a secret set to something
     that matches nothing — all indistinguishable from a clean tree. A
     positive control now runs first: a name from the secret is planted in a
     canary file and the scan MUST find it, plus a shape check that the secret
     was not truncated. What NO check inside CI can prove is that the secret
     still lists the RIGHT names — the control plants a name taken from that
     same secret, which is circular. That gap is real; it is bounded by the
     shape check and named here rather than papered over.

  3. The list was negative; the policy (§13) is positive. Grepping for known
     bad names cannot catch a NEW client nobody thought to forbid. So the
     structured surface is checked the other way round: every reference entry
     must be a whitelisted name or a neutral placeholder.

What this still does not do, stated plainly rather than implied: it cannot
read free prose for an unknown company name. Hole 3 is closed for the
reference collection — where client names structurally live — not for every
sentence on the site.
