/**
 * ci-check-hero-frames.mjs — what an opening's animation frame costs (#568).
 *
 * Big Data's Lighthouse score swung between 0.70 and 0.98 on one build. The
 * swing was blocking time: Lighthouse charged the scene's animation frames as
 * long tasks, under «Other» — canvas raster, which runs on the main thread of
 * a renderer without a GPU, Lighthouse's included. ~70% of every frame was one
 * line, `ctx.filter = "blur(3px)"` on the dusk's cut-outs, re-run on each
 * repaint although the cut-outs never move within a layout.
 *
 * Nothing could see it. Lighthouse names the script, not the line; whole-page
 * busy time could not tell blur from no blur at all; and the obvious suspect
 * (700 stars painted one by one) measured WORSE when cached. What found it was
 * driving the frames by hand. This gate is that measurement:
 *
 *   every route that asks for animation frames is loaded with the clock in
 *   our hands — performance.now and requestAnimationFrame replaced — on
 *   Lighthouse's phone viewport with the CPU slowed ×4 as Lighthouse does,
 *   and its frames are drawn from the night's beat to the end at 60 fps,
 *   each followed by a raster flush so the pixels are paid inside the frame.
 *
 *   F1  no per-pixel effect is re-run per frame: across the whole loop, the
 *       `filter` and `shadowBlur` a 2D context is given are set at most once
 *       per canvas. Constant work is done once per layout and composited.
 *       This is the defect itself, and it does not depend on the machine.
 *
 *   F2  the scene's steady frame stays under Lighthouse's long-task line,
 *       50 ms, at ×4: its 90th-percentile frame. Not its worst — the frame
 *       that builds a layout's constants is allowed over the line once (the
 *       bargain F1 asks for), and a single frame can spike on a busy machine
 *       (GC; measured 33–122 ms between three runs of one unchanged route).
 *       Main's Big Data drew EVERY frame at 41–48 ms on a fast laptop, which
 *       is what a slower runner turns into blocking time. This one depends on
 *       the machine, which is why it is the second assertion and why the
 *       figures are printed for every route either way.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/ci-check-hero-frames.mjs [base-url] [route-regex]   default :8787, every route
