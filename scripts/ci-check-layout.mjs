/**
 * ci-check-layout.mjs — the geometry gate (#453).
 *
 * The areas block shipped as six white boxes, each carrying a full paragraph.
 * Measured on the running stack before this change: 1695px tall on a 390px
 * phone — two whole screens for six names — with row heights of 214, 282, 282,
 * 283, 259 and 305px. Ragged item heights are the actual reason a list starts
 * demanding boxes to tidy it up, so the fix equalises the lines and drops the
 * box. This gate is what keeps it equalised, because nothing else in CI can
 * see composition:
 *
 *   · `copy-baseline` freezes the WORDS. It froze the duplicated excerpt too,
 *     happily, for as long as it was there.
 *   · `ci-check-design-tokens.py` reads CSS as text and never opens a browser.
 *   · `ci-check-a11y.mjs` measures contrast and reflow, and a ragged list is
 *     neither illegible nor overflowing.
 *   · `ci-check-var-resolves.mjs` asks whether a declaration survived, not
 *     what it drew.
 *
 * Three assertions to begin with, all over the rendered page:
 *
 *   G1  every ROW list has equal row heights — max − min ≤ 8px — at 390, 768
 *       and 1440. Eight pixels is a hairline plus a rounding error, not a
 *       design allowance: two rows that differ by more than that read as two
 *       different things.
 *
 *   G2  a ROW draws no box AT REST. No radius, no shadow, and the left accent
 *       transparent. The colour is a state — hover, focus, current — and a row
 *       that paints a container at rest is a card. Six of them are a grid
 *       pretending to be a list, which is exactly what #453 removed.
 *
 *   G3  no long run of copy is printed twice on the same page. The e-commerce
 *       excerpt used to appear verbatim in the hero card and again in the areas
 *       row, twenty lines apart, which is what made the block read as filler.
 *       That defect is invisible to every other gate: the copy baseline had it
 *       frozen in, and a duplicate is neither a contrast nor a token fault.
 *
 * Six more arrived with the footer (#454), which had the same class of defect —
 * geometry no gate could see:
 *
 *   G4  the reference strip is ONE line where there is room for one. Measured
 *       before the change: 6 marks and a seventh alone below, at both 1024 and
 *       1440, because the strip inherited the reading column's 840px while the
 *       set needs ~930. A lone mark under a full line reads as an accident, and
 *       the marks are the credibility of the page.
 *
 *   G5  every line of the strip is centred within it (±8px). Flex centres a
 *       partial line for free; a grid does not, and the obvious "tidy this into
 *       a grid" refactor is exactly what would leave a wrapped mark hard left.
 *
 *   G6  nothing in the footer is centre-aligned. It used to be centred below
 *       768px and left above it, so the same footer read as two designs
 *       depending on the phone in your hand. Checked at all four widths, which
 *       is what makes "one alignment everywhere" a measurement and not a hope.
 *
 *   G7  the EU emblem renders at least 37.8 CSS px tall — 1cm at 96dpi, the
 *       minimum in `eu-emblem-rules_es.pdf` p.10, whose duty that same document
 *       extends to "sitios web y sus versiones móviles". Measured on the FLAG,
 *       not the lockup around it: each mark declares the flag's share of its own
 *       artwork in `data-emblem-ratio`, because a 40px lockup whose flag is 88%
 *       of it renders a 35px emblem while looking compliant. The single 2560×242
 *       JPEG we shipped rendered it at 18.2px on a 390px phone: a compliance
 *       failure, penalty 10% of the aid, that no gate here could see and no
 *       amount of reading the CSS would reveal.
 *
 *   G8  every link in the footer's nav lists renders at one size. There were
 *       five — 13, 14, 17, 18 and 20px — and the home's own body copy sat below
 *       two of them.
 *
 *   G10 nothing in the footer crosses the page's ONE measure. `theme.css` says
 *       it in as many words — "There is no second measure. A page has ONE width
 *       and everything inside it shares one edge." Nothing could check it until
 *       now, and the first draft of this very footer broke it: both sides of the
 *       signature row were shrinkable, the columns lost, shrank to 403px, and
 *       their `nowrap` children painted the CTA 73.7px past the container's
 *       right edge. The reference banner is exempt by construction — it carries
 *       its own, wider measure, for marks rather than prose.
 *
 *   G11 the EU emblem outweighs every other mark on the funding line by at least
 *       1.3×. `Orden HFP/1030/2021` art. 9.4 binds only "al menos de forma tan
 *       prominente y visible como los otros logotipos", which equal heights meet.
 *       The `Guía de Justificación` red.es asks a compliance screenshot against
 *       recommends "como mínimo, un 30% más grande que el resto de los
 *       logotipos", and the Enero 2022 identity manual makes that ratio binding
 *       for cartelería. Meeting the strictest of the three costs one declaration.
 *
 *   G12 no rule that selects a funding mark may fade, recolour, rotate, crop or
 *       otherwise modify it. The marks are supplied artwork: the EU emblem's own
 *       usage rules and the `Manual de Identidad` both say they may be SCALED and
 *       nothing else, and art. 34.3 of Orden ETD/1498/2021 makes carrying them
 *       correctly an obligation rather than a courtesy — art. 38.4 prices a
 *       publicity breach at 10% of the awarded aid. G7 and G11 protect the size
 *       half; nothing protected the integrity half.
 *
 *       This one reads the STYLESHEET, not the rendered rest state, and that is
 *       the whole point: a `:hover` or `:focus` rule that fades a mark on
 *       interaction is invisible to any measurement of the page at rest, and
 *       interaction is the plausible way this breaks — somebody gives every
 *       footer image a tasteful hover.
 *
 *       The walk reads declarations BEFORE recursing. The obvious shape is
 *       wrong and fails silently, which is how #470's version of this reported
 *       clean forever while its own control passed: CSS Nesting gives every
 *       CSSStyleRule its own `cssRules` — an empty list when nothing is nested,
 *       and truthy — so `if (r.cssRules) { walk(r.cssRules); continue; }` skips
 *       every ordinary rule in the sheet. Measured on the built `Base` sheet on
 *       2026-09-02: 222 top-level rules, 14 reached. So the gate does not take
 *       its own walk on trust either — it counts the style rules it actually
 *       READ against the number the sheet declares at top level, and refuses to
 *       report clean if it read fewer. Counting rules *visited* would not do:
 *       the wrong shape still enters every top-level rule, recurses into its
 *       empty `cssRules` and reads nothing, so it scores 222 of 222 visited and
 *       0 leaves. The leaf count is the one that tells them apart.
 *
 *   G19 a framed photograph paints a frame and nothing else: four border edges
 *       of one width and one colour, and no shadow. `docs/design-system.md`
 *       used to list *photograph* among PANEL's surfaces, which would have
 *       given the three faces on the home a 4px accent stripe and the site's
 *       only shadow. The tree never did that, and the answer (#482) is that a
 *       photograph is not a container at all — a container holds content, and
 *       an image IS content. Its border is a frame on the picture, not chrome
 *       around a box, which is why the benchmark's instrument counts it as a
 *       tuple and the system does not name it. This assertion is what keeps
 *       the tree on the side of that answer: the drift ran doc-to-tree once
 *       and could as easily run the other way.
 *
 *   G20 no body copy runs past MEASURE_MAX characters a line. Measured the way
 *       `bench-visual.mjs` measures it — box width divided by the mean advance
 *       of a-z in the element's OWN resolved font — because faces differ by
 *       more than 10% in average advance and an em approximation compares the
 *       CSS rather than the type.
 *
 *       Two things this deliberately does NOT do (#481). It does not cap a
 *       line's width: `theme.css` says "there is no second measure… everything
 *       inside it ends at the same edge" (#304), and a max-width on prose is
 *       exactly the second edge that forbids. The lever is type size, which is
 *       why the fix that ships with this assertion is 16px -> 18px and not a
 *       narrower column. And it ignores anything under BODY_MIN_PX: at one
 *       measure, smaller type buys more characters by arithmetic, every site
 *       in the benchmark set does the same (Test Double 106, Simple Thread
 *       194 in fine print), and an assertion that fired on a 13px disclaimer
 *       would be asserting the column width under another name.
 *
 *   G9  the footer paints no ground of its own — transparent, or at worst the
 *       body's own colour. Giving the footer its own band is what makes a footer
 *       read as bolt-on, and the rule that used to be here painted
 *       `--color-secondary` over a body that is already that colour: a band
 *       waiting to become visible the day either token moves.
 *
 * Four more with the page openings (#456), where the defect was that the
 * header's own height was a magic number nobody had measured:
 *
 *   G15 `--header-h` matches the header the browser actually draws. Twelve
 *       declarations across eight stylesheets used to spell the opening inset
 *       as `calc(80px + …)` below 768 and `calc(100px + …)` above it. The
 *       header measures 69px and 78px. BOTH literals were wrong — the desktop
 *       one by 22px — and nothing could say so, because a wrong constant is
 *       not a wrong declaration. This is the assertion that makes the token a
 *       measurement instead of a guess.
 *
 *   G16 every document opening reserves the same inset: `--header-h` plus
 *       `--open-clear`, and nothing else. Before, the same h1 opened at 104,
 *       140 or 160px depending on which stylesheet the page happened to
 *       import — six different values across the page types at 1440. The two
 *       photographic bands are exempt BY NAME in `OPENING_ROUTES`, not by
 *       accident: their copy is centred against a plate whose subject is
 *       registered to that column at build time, and top-aligning it ran the
 *       kicker straight through the drawing. Measured, then reverted.
 *
 *   G17 nothing decorative is painted `position: fixed` behind the document.
 *       `.s-emblem-bg` was a 340px cube at 7% opacity fixed across the whole
 *       viewport at `z-index: -1`. Being fixed, its relationship to the copy
 *       was whatever the scroll offset happened to be: on «Quiénes somos» it
 *       crossed the boot console, the lede, a section heading and four
 *       paragraphs at once. A fixed layer below the content cannot be composed
 *       with anything, which is the whole objection, and it is invisible to
 *       every other gate — it changes no contrast, no token and no word.
 *
 *   G18 `.s-hero__card` opens above the fold at 390×844. The card is the only
 *       thing in the hero band that says what we do; a phone that has to
 *       scroll to reach it is a phone that was shown a picture and a heading.
 *
 *   G21 the hero's mark keeps DIE_CLEAR px between its silhouette and the copy,
 *       the band's two edges and the header, at every width it is shown at and
 *       through the whole tumble. Measured on the six FACES and across the
 *       CYCLE, because a cube is widest between stations, not at one: the first
 *       cut of #517 was sized on its resting width and crossed the card by 5px
 *       mid-relay at 1280x800, where `overflow: clip` sliced it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a screenshot diff. A pixel diff over 26 routes would go red
 * on every PR in this redesign by design, get re-baselined on sight, and become
 * furniture. Machines assert geometry; whether the composition is any good is a
 * human judgement and pretending otherwise is how a redesign gets approved by a
 * green checkmark.
 *
 * Exit 0 clean · 1 found something · 3 the scan itself is blind or broke.
