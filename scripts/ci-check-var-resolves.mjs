/**
 * ci-check-var-resolves.mjs — the phantom `var()` gate (#452).
 *
 * Two bugs shipped in the same week and they were the same bug. An unresolved
 * `var()` with no fallback does not fall back: per CSS Variables §3.2 it makes
 * the declaration *invalid at computed-value time*, and the element loses the
 * property altogether.
 *
 *     font-family: var(--font-mono), monospace;   →  #450: rendered SANS
 *     background:  var(--accentColor);            →  #460: rendered NOTHING
 *
 * Read as source, both lines are correct, and that is the trap. `--font-mono`
 * is defined by Astro's `<Font>` component, which was rendered nowhere, so six
 * declarations quietly inherited sans and the brand's shell prompt stopped
 * being monospace. `--accentColor` comes from `define:vars` on a parent
 * component's `<style>`, which reaches that component's own template and not
 * its children, so on twelve vertical routes the primary CTA's background
 * vanished while its hard-coded white label did not: white on a white panel.
 *
 * Nothing in CI could see either. `ci-check-design-tokens.py` scans CSS as
 * text — it never starts a browser and never resolves a `var()`, so it is
 * blind to this class by construction, not by omission. And axe reported zero
 * contrast violations on all twelve routes, correctly: the button did not
 * become illegible, it became *absent*, and absence is not a contrast failure.
 *
 * So this gate asks the only authority that can answer, the rendered page:
 *
 *   G1  every custom property a matching rule references must RESOLVE on the
 *       elements that rule matches, on every route where it matches.
 *
 *   G2  a `var()` whose property is not declared on `:root` must carry a
 *       fallback. Those are precisely the runtime-injected ones — `define:vars`,
 *       inline `style=`, a component that may not have rendered — the ones
 *       whose presence is a *timing* question rather than a spelling one.
 *       G1 detects; G2 makes the worst case ink instead of nothing.
 *
 * G2 is deliberately not "every `var()` needs a fallback". `--color-primary`
 * is declared on `:root` in theme.css and resolves everywhere by construction;
 * demanding a fallback there is churn that trains readers to skip the rule.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/ci-check-var-resolves.mjs [base-url]   default :8787
