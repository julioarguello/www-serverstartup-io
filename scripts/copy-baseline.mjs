/**
 * Rendered-copy baseline — catches text regressions that compile green.
 *
 * Why a browser and not an HTML parser
 * ------------------------------------
 * The first version of this gate parsed HTML and concatenated text nodes. It
 * reported 26 of 26 routes broken on the Astro 7 migration, and every one was
 * a FALSE POSITIVE.
 *
 * The cause, measured 2026-08-21 with both stacks running side by side:
 * `compressHTML: 'jsx'` strips whitespace-only text nodes between sibling
 * elements. Inside a flex container those nodes never rendered in the first
 * place — CSS Flexbox does not render a whitespace-only anonymous item — so
 * removing them changes nothing a reader sees. An HTML parser cannot know
 * that; it turned each one into a space, and then reported the space missing.
 *
 * Measured on `.search-ps` → `.search-chrome`, with the search actually open:
 *
 *     ASTRO 6      ASTRO 7
 *     hueco 9px    hueco 9px     ← identical; the gap is `margin-right: 9px`
 *     1 text node  0 text nodes  ← the only real difference
 *
 * A gate that cries wolf on every route is worse than no gate: it gets
 * re-baselined on sight, and the day it fires for real nobody looks. So the
 * extraction has to be CSS-aware, which means a browser.
 *
 * `document.body.innerText` is exactly the right primitive: it is defined as
 * the rendered text, so it resolves flex whitespace, `display: none`, and
 * `visibility: hidden` the way the reader's eye does. Content that is hidden
 * until interaction (the search prompt) is legitimately absent — it is not
 * copy anyone is reading.
 *
 * `<details>` is the exception, and it is opened before reading. A collapsed
 * panel IS copy someone reads, one click away, and it is CMS-authored like the
 * rest; leaving it out would have quietly exempted the six layer panels of
 * /deconstruyendo from the gate the moment they shipped — measured 2026-08-24,
 * the baseline captured none of their text. A guard with a hole that shape
 * looks exactly like a guard.
 *
 * What it still catches — the reason the gate exists
 * ---------------------------------------------------
 * Under JSX whitespace rules two expressions on adjacent lines GLUE:
 *
 *     {posts.length}
 *     {posts.length === 1 ? t("article_singular") : t("article_plural")}
 *
 * renders `12artículos`, not `12 artículos`, in normal flow. `innerText` shows
 * that, because it is a real change in rendered text.
 *
 * It also catches the larger failure: if the CMS read path shifts, whole
 * paragraphs go missing rather than words gluing, and the diff shows it as a
 * lost block.
 *
 * Determinism
 * -----------
 * Viewport is pinned: `innerText` is layout-dependent and a different width
 * would re-wrap responsive content. `networkidle0` plus a settle delay, because
 * measuring during a transition captures the start frame — a lesson this repo
 * has already paid for once in the a11y gate.
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *     node scripts/copy-baseline.mjs capture --base-url http://localhost:8787
 *     node scripts/copy-baseline.mjs verify  --base-url http://localhost:8787
 *
 * `verify` exits non-zero and names the file and line of the first difference.
 * Re-run `capture` deliberately when copy legitimately changes — that is the
 * maintenance cost of the gate, accepted knowingly.

/*
 * Positive control (#385)
 * -----------------------
 * Three ways this gate can go quiet while still printing "26 routes match the
 * baseline": the route list stops enumerating anything, `renderText` stops
 * returning text (a selector change, a page that renders empty), or the
 * comparator stops finding differences. All three look identical from the
 * outside — a green line — so the run proves each of them false before it
 * trusts a single route.
 *
 * The fixture is a mutation of what the browser just rendered, held in
 * memory. Nothing is planted in `tests/copy-baseline/`: a canary living in the
 * tree it guards is how the citability gate died the second time (#347).

 * Re-baselining: the procedure, and why it is not optional

 *
 *   1. A REGRESSION — copy changed and nobody meant it. Fix the code.
 *   2. An INTENDED copy change — then re-capture and commit the new baseline
 *      IN THE SAME PR, so the diff is reviewed as content:
 *
 *          scripts/ci-local-stack.sh 8787
 *          node scripts/copy-baseline.mjs capture --base-url http://localhost:8787
 *          git add tests/copy-baseline/   # review this diff like prose
 *
 * What must never happen is a re-capture on a red run "to make it pass". This
 * gate already died once that way: its first version cried wolf on 26 of 26
 * routes, and a gate that always fires is a gate nobody reads on the day it is
 * right. If a diff is not obviously one of the two cases above, it is the
