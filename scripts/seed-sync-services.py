"""Sync live CMS entries back into seed/seed.json.

Why: seed/seed.json must be the complete, canonical text corpus — a clean
rebuild from seeds alone must reproduce every text on the site. Copy is
authored in seed/content/<collection>/<locale>/*.md and loaded into the live
CMS (which converts markdown to Portable Text server-side, link markDefs
included). This script closes the loop: it reads the converted entries from
the local D1 database and splices them into the matching entries of seed.json,
preserving the file's tab formatting so diffs stay minimal.

Any collection, not just services (#305): `pages` needed the same round trip
the moment its copy grew links, and hand-forging markDefs in JSON is how two
locale mix-ups reached the tree in one week. The fields written back are the
ones the seed entry ALREADY declares, intersected with the table's real
columns — no hardcoded field list to drift.

Usage: run AFTER load-content.sh has pushed the latest markdown (see
seed/content/README.md for the whole loop and the server it needs):
    python3 scripts/seed-sync-services.py [collection ...]   # default: services

Requires: a seeded local D1 (dev server may be running; reads are safe).
