/**
 * Hero art (#413) — one drawn plate per vertical, keyed by the face it owns.
 *
 * The six images are the SAME object: the brand cube, with each trade doing
 * something different to it (repeats it, wraps it round the world, draws it
 * out of data, pierces it, builds it, lights it from inside). That is why the
 * key is the FACE, not the slug: slugs are translated and there are two per
 * vertical, while the cross never reorders — the same map the menu, the
 * emblem and the die already share (`FACE_BY_SLUG` in nav.ts).
 *
 * Each plate is TWO files: a transparent SVG drawing and, under it, a real
 * NASA photograph. The founder, 2026-08-29: *"que NO pierda los dibujitos…
 * usemos las fotos como background… pero tendrás que quitarles peso."* So the
 * drawing is still the subject and the photograph is only the room it hangs
 * in — darkened, desaturated and cropped at build time so the photograph's
 * own subject lands under the drawing's. Both halves are generated, never
 * hand-edited:
 * `docs/design/hero-rotativo/generate.py` draws the plates and `grounds.py`
 * treats the photographs (and records what each one is and who to credit).
 *
 * They live in `public/assets/` rather than the CMS for the reason §7 of the
 * project rules gives for team photos and logos: R2 media is not seedable, so
 * a clean rebuild would lose them and every environment would need a manual
 * upload.
